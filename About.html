							At WPI I was very excited to begin my degree in Mechanical Engineering. My freshman year I lived in Sanford Riley Hall. I joined the American Society of Mechanical Engineers as well as the Society of Manufacturing Engineers. In addition, I became a brother of Theta Chi Fraternity Epsilon Chapter.

							In my sophmore year, I was elected house manager. My responsibilities involved maintaining the facilities of our 45 brother chapter house, fascilitate improvements with our Alumni housing board, and organizing Projects days twice a semester. On Projects days, all brothers would be assigned projects to fix and build upon the house. In my junior year, I was elected Treasurer. I created and maintained a $400,000 annual budget for our facility expenses. Both executive positions in my Fraternity have been very beneficial leadership experiences.
