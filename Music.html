		<p class="startmusic">Music has always been a big part of my life. I started playing drums when I was 8 and took lessons for many years. After I gained confidence in mastering the drum set I needed another challenge. I bought a ukulele and taught myself ukulele over the summer going into my senior year of high school. This was very fun for me and I wanted to learn even more. I figured if i could teach myself ukulele over a summer then guitar would not be much harder. I was wrong and spent my freshman year struggling to learn bar chords and fingerstyle patterns. In between classes I would find small amounts of time to play. The slow growth pushed me to learn more and more each day. It has been such a fun and rewarding journey and I can say today that I sucessfully taught myself guitar and ukulele.
